#### When to use Surge

- You need a drop-in graphics engine for your C++ project
- You need a simple, cross-platform way to draw graphics

- You want a simple way to draw graphics while using ImGui for your interface
- You need to plot real-time graphs and charts with minimal effort
- You want to use OpenGL, but don't want to deal with the boilerplate code
- Other frameworks, such as Cinder or OpenFrameworks are too large and complex for your needs

#### When not to use Surge

- You need a full game engine
- You want to use a well-known framework with every feature you could imagine
- You need uncommon features which are not present in Surge
- You need a professional-looking UI for your application
