#### When to use Surge

- You need a drop-in graphics engine for your C++ project
- You need a simple, cross-platform way to draw graphics
- You want to create visualisations for your programs, rather than just using the terminal
- You want a simple way to draw graphics while using ImGui for your interface
- You need to plot real-time graphs and charts with minimal effort
- You want to use OpenGL, but don't want to deal with the boilerplate code
- Other frameworks, such as Cinder or OpenFrameworks are too large and complex for your needs

#### When not to use Surge

- You need a full game engine
- You want to use a well-known framework with every feature you could imagine
- You need uncommon features which are not present in Surge
- You need a professional-looking UI for your application

## Examples

There are a range of example programs available in
the [examples](https://github.com/Pencilcaseman/surge/tree/master/examples) directory. These show off some of the basic
features of the library and are designed to give you an idea of how to use Surge in your own projects.
